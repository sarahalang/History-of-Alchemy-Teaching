Teaching Materials on the history of alchemy

This repository thus far contains:
1. **An introduction to alchemy (in GERMAN)** which can be read or used for a 1-1,5h intro talk / class. It is simplified (for didactical reduction purposes) yet still relatively close to the current state of research, containing some references to secondary literature as well.
